<h1>PORT HAWAII INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
<p class="sub-text">Tracking and managing all vessels that travel to and from ports in Hawaii. This includes cargo, tariffs, billing and more.</p>

  I incorporated scrum / agile methodologies within my team at the start of the project in order to meet a
  3 year deadline. In addition, I led FE development and UI / UX design, which included creating mock-ups
  using Adobe XD. I integrated UX in our software development process. This increased team velocity from 4
  points to 8 points per person since development could proceed with client approved designs. For the FE,
  we used Vue.js and I paired it with View UI for its simplistic components.
