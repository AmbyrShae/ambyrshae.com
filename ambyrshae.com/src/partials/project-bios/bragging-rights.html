  Bragging Rights was a little side project I did while I was working at GE Digital. There was a Women's Group that I was a part of 
  and we met bi-weekly to discuss hurdles women face in tech. I wanted to expand my FE knowledge while also helping out the group and 
  that's when our monthly "Bragging Rights" formed. We used the website to show a short bio of the speaker and a graph of highs and lows 
  of their life and career. It allowed women a safe space to open up about obstacles they faced but also to express moments where they 
  were proud of themselves.
