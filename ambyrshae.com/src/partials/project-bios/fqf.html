      My very first software project was the French Quarter Festival mobile app. I helped develop the Android app natively 
      using Android Studio, Java, Material Design and Espresso testing. I also lead my team in scrum and agile methodologies so 
      that we could meet our 2 month deadline. I then rolled off the project as a developer and became a mentor for 3 years. 
      I guided interns on development, design and project management.
