<h1>FIELD VISION</h1>
<p class="sub-text">
  Helping field engineers easily navigate daily processes during plant shutdowns such as managing shifts, reporting 
  incidents and submitting reports online and offline.
</p>
<p class="pb-1">
  I collaborated with a 100+ member team and worked closely with business analysts, QAs and UX designers on a
  daily basis. I programmed in Angular and Spring Boot to build out offline reports. This assured that field
  engineers could easily manage, review and send out reports even in areas where internet service was not available.
