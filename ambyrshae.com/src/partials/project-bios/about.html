<p>Hi, I'm AmbyrShae but friends call me Shae.</p>
<p>
  I've been working in software development for 6 years.
  I'm always looking for ways to improve processes so that teams can excel. This has lead me to become involved in various aspects
  of the software development cycle. I've worn many hats which includes developer, UI / UX designer, scrum master, agile coach, and mentor.
